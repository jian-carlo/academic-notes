= Biogeochemical Cycles

== Hydrogen (Hydro/Water) Cycle

The surface water that comprises of the oceans the lakes of the earth
evaporates using the heat from the sun's radiation. This is called
_insolation_. Plants can also release water into the atmosphere by a
process called _transpiration_.

The formation of clouds is called _condensation_. Clouds are the clumped up
water in saturated liquid form. In the _cumolonimbus_ clouds, the clump becomes
tall and internal precipitation within the clouds happen. In contrast the
_cirrus_ clouds are those horizontal strips of clouds that signifies that the
weather is calm. _Transportation_ is the movement of clouds by wind.

When clouds precipitate, they can go to mountains or places with high altitude.
These areas have lower temperatures and the precipitate can freeze.

When clouds precipitate, they can go to mountains or places with high altitude.
These areas have lower temperatures and the precipitate can freeze and will
turn to snow, of which the _snowmelt runoff_ will get them back to the cycle.

When water reaches the ground, it will first _infiltrate_ through it. And if
there are acquifers nearby, they might percolate through it as well.

== Carbon Cycle

Fossil carbon consists of the coal, diamonds, graphite, petroleum, natural gas,
and etc. These came from the decay of organic matter that were buried down in
time. These carbon can then escape into the surface by human excavation or by
weathering.

When carbon is burned, it will evolve into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
And this gas will be absorbed by plants and algae via photosynthesis. These
plants that can use carbon dioxide and produce their own energy from the sun's
radiation are called _autotrophs_. And they are at the highest energy level.
The _heterotrophs_ on the other hand are those that rely on other species for
their sustenance.

== Oxygen Cycle

Plants release oxygen from photosynthesis. Most organisms on earth rely on
oxygen to live by means of cellular respiration. The decay of organic matter
also requires oxygen.

Oxygen is an _oxidizing agent_. These sets of elements or compounds are able to
form radicals. That is why some say that oxygen is a killer especially as we
get older the amount of oxygen we breathe accumulates.

== Nitrogen Cycle

_Nitrfying bacteria_ turn the ammonia from decomposing organic matter into
nitrites and then into nitrates. _Nitrogen fixation_ on the other hand produces
ammonium. And these compounds are useful to human life as these get
_assimilated_ to living beings as nutrition. Nitrogen is an essential element
of proteins after all. And the cycle continues by death and decay.

A problem exists in bodies of water where excess amounts of nitrogen are
accumulating. This is called _eutrophication_ where the flora blooms rapidly
thus decreasing the levels of oxygen in the body of water. On the other hand,
bodies of water with a deficiency in nitrogen are called _dead zones_.

== Sulfur Cycle

Sulfur is a part of fossil. It is grouped with the elements that come from
decomposition of organic matter such as carbon and nitrogen. From decay, it will
turn into sulfates, and its runoff can then turn to sulfuric acid. An example
is acid rain.

= Atmospheric Dynamics and Meterology

A question that is important in air pollution control is "Where will the
pollutants go?" It is important to know that no 100% separate pollutants, and
some go away to disperse or accumulate in the atmosphere. This is where
atmospheric dynamics and meteorology come into play.

== Difference between Atmospheric Dynamics and Meterology

Atmospheric dynamics focus more on the long term effects and rely on physical
laws to make predictions. However, meteorology focuses more on day to day
weather.

== What is an Air Parcel?

An air parcel is a theoretical bubble of air used by meteorologists to explain
weather phenomena. They study the behavior of vertical transport of air parcels
and what happens to its temperature when it expands or compresses.

== Temperature Inversion

Warm air tends to rise and cold air tends to sink. _Temperature_ (or _thermal_)
inversion results when the layer cold air sits on top of warm air. In effect,
pollutants are trapped since air cannot escape through the layer of warm air.
Normally the ground is warm and the temperature decreases as altitude increases
atleast in the troposphere.

_Atmosoheric stability_ is defined as the resistance of wind to vertical
transport. In retrospect, instability is preferred since it is easier to
disperse the pollutants over a large area.

== Wind Speed

Wind speed can be calculated using the equation below

$
  V = (V_"ref")/(kappa) ln Z/Z_0
$<eq:vonkarmann>

#where[
  / $V$: is the velocity
  / $V_"ref"$: is the reference velocity
  / $kappa$: is the von karmann constant \~ 0.4
  / $Z$: is the height
  / $Z_0$: is the roughness
]

The sudden burst of wind at a certain season is attributed to the shear between
different wind currents. For example, in the Philippines the shear lines between
the northeast monsoon and the easterlies causes strong winds in te country.
